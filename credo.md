#Credo

##1. Ignore the sinner, fight the sin.

Don't talk about how anyone voted.  Don't mention the president-elect or the other nominee, it will only cause defensiveness and entrenchment.  Focus on issues and don't turn them into another form of identity politics where sides are taken reflexively.

##2. Give everyone a chance to engage in good faith.  Give your adversary the space to make the right move.

Vader can still throw the Emperor over the railing.

##3. Outcomes, not outrage.

Focus on specific, achievable results. Conduct protest in a manner that has a self-describing endpoint: "I will withdraw my protest when X condition is satisfied." 

##4. Begin with issues that should have the broadest base of appeal.  Corollary: work for the restoring of norms.

Explicit racism should continue to be socially unacceptable.  White nationalism (much less white supremacy) should be easy to oppose, so it should be easy to find allies in its opposition.  Anyone who doesn't readily oppose it, assume they will not engage in good faith in the future.

##5. If #4 doesn't work, if it causes me to lose my faith... time for a new credo.
